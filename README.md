# ZachariahPrice-BankAPP

# Hello and Welcome to my BadBank banking App.

## This is my submission for the final assignment of my MIT course.

 ### What the features includes are, 

Home page, Create Account page, Deposit page, Withdraw and All Data.

The Home page is the first page you see when you load onto the website. This is basically just explaing what the website is about and includes an image or a logo. 

Create Account page is where you can an account, which requires a name, email and password. This information is then sent to the all data page to be displayed. Again, this bank has no security because we didn't learn back-end in this course. So the name, email and password will be displayed.

The Deposit and Withdraw page is where you can deposit and withdraw money, it's just typing in a number of course, not real life money. The data from this is shared across with the Withdraw page so the account balance is updated when you either deposit or withdraw.

Finally, the All Data page is where the information from the create account page is stored, you can openly see the name, email and password you typed in in the create account page.
